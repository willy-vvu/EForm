# E-Form

![](EForm1.jpg)

When I designed, prototyped, and built a [MIDI controller](https://github.com/willy-vvu/Mixer) last year, I thought 8 knobs and 8 faders would be fine. However, I quickly felt limited by its expressive power. Since then, I've been longing to produce another electronic music interface able to capture more of a musician's nuance through human touch, which is inherently multidimensional.

E-Form is an expressive multitouch music controller, sensitive to x/y position as well as pressure on its smooth surface. Thin and light, the controller is designed for music production as well as performance on-the-go. Using it, I produced a [few short songs](https://soundcloud.com/william-vvu/sets/balance).
